# Python Training

All training material currently in this repo is in development stage and may be subject to change.

## Ethos

The aim of this training is to support individuals who want to get to grips with Python and use it in project work, while also serving as a comprehensive reference for more experienced users.

Training material should be interactive and accessible - little to no prior knowledge of Python and environments should be required to engage with and learn from the content.

Taught concepts will be broken down into bitesize chunks so that Zifo employees can use it alongside their daily responsibilities - the aim for this is around an hour for each chunk.

Each chunk will contain an explanation of the concept

## Format

Most content will be offered in the form of IPython notebooks. Doing so allows theoretical context to be displayed alongside interactive code so that the user can visualise and modify the effects of taught concepts first-hand.

These IPython notebooks will be hosted on a Binder server that can be accessed through a link. Individual instances are allocated to each user so changes can be made to notebooks without affecting others. A global Python environment will be created using Anaconda with all required packages pre-installed.

## Plan
